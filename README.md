Client-side build: 
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/647c7141-1bde-466c-a4fa-0029b4dc01f8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/festive-poincare-dd4ab7/deploys)

A playable in-browser clone of Cards Against Humanity. The server is unfortunately not running so it isn't playable, but it should be easy to clone the repo and run. If there was interest in the project I would consider having the server up permanently, as of right now it's not a priority.
